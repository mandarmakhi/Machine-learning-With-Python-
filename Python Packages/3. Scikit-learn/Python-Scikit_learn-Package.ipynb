    "# What is Scikit-learn Package?\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn (formerly scikits.learn and also known as sklearn) is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important features of scikit-learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "● Simple  and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "● Accessible to everybody and reusable in various contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "● Built on the top of NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "●Open source, commercially usable – BSD license.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we are going to see how we can easily build a machine learning model using scikit-learn."

    "\n",
    "A dataset is nothing but a collection of data. A dataset generally has two main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "● Features: (also known as predictors, inputs, or attributes) they are simply the variables of our data. They can be more than one and hence represented by a feature matrix (‘X’ is a common notation to represent feature matrix). A list of all the feature names is termed as feature names.\n",
    "\n",
    "● Response: (also known as the target, label, or output) This is the output variable depending on the feature variables. We generally have a single response column and it is represented by a response vector (‘y’ is a common notation to represent response vector). All the possible values taken by a response vector is termed as target names.\n",
    "\n",
    "● Loading exemplar dataset: scikit-learn comes loaded with a few example datasets like the iris and digits datasets for classification and the boston house prices dataset for regression."
