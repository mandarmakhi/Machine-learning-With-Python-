    "# What is  TensorFlow Package ?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow is a library for high-performance numerical computations with around 35,000 comments and a vibrant community of about 1,500 contributors. It’s used across various scientific fields. TensorFlow is a framework for defining and running computations that involve tensors, which are partially defined computational objects that eventually produce a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "● Better computational graph visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "● Reduces error by 50 to 60 percent in neural machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "● Parallel computing to execute complex models\n",
    "\n",
    "● Seamless library management backed by Google\n",
    "\n",
    "● Quicker updates and frequent new releases to provide you with the latest features\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### TensorFlow is particularly useful for the following applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "● Speech and image recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "● Text-based applications\n",
    "\n",
    "● Time-series analysis\n",

    "# TensorFlow APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow provides multiple APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). These can be classified into 2 major categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Low level API:\n",
    "●complete programming control\n",
    "\n",
    "●recommended for machine learning researchers\n",
    "\n",
    "●provides fine levels of control over the models\n",
    "\n",
    "●TensorFlow Core is the low level API of TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. High level API:\n",
    "\n",
    "● built on top of TensorFlow Core\n",
    "\n",
    "● easier to learn and use than TensorFlow Core\n",
    "\n",
    "● make repetitive tasks easier and more consistent between different users\n",
    "\n",
    "● tf.contrib.learn is an example of a high level API.\n",
    "\n",
    "we first discuss the basics of TensorFlow Core and then explore the higher level API, tf.contrib.learn.\n",

    "## TensorFlow Core\n",

    "### 1. Installing TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "An easy to follow guide for TensorFlow installation is available here:\n",
    "Installing TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once installed, you can ensure a successful installation by running this command in python interpreter:\n",
    "\n",
    "## import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The Computational Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "Any TensorFlow Core program can be divided into two discrete sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "● Building the computational graph.A computational graph is nothing but a series of TensorFlow operations arranged into a graph of nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "● Running the computational graph.To actually evaluate the nodes, we must run the computational graph within a session. A session encapsulates the control and state of the TensorFlow runtime."
