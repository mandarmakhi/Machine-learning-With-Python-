What is machine learning?

Machine learning is the branch of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on building applications that learn from data and improve their accuracy over time without being programmed to do so. 
In data science, the algorithm is a sequence of statistical processing steps. In machine learning, algorithms are 'trained' to find patterns and features in massive amounts of data to make decisions and predictions based on new data. The better algorithm is a more accurate decision and prediction will become as it processes more data.
Examples of machine learning are all around us. Search the web and play music in response to our voice commands like digital assistants (ex: Alexa, Bixby, Google Assistant). Websites recommend products and movies and songs based on what we bought, watched or listened to before. Robots vacuum our floors while we do something better with our time. Spam detectors stop unwanted emails from reaching our inboxes. Medical image analysis systems help doctors spot tumors they might have missed. And the first self-driving cars are hitting the road.
We can expect more. As big data keep getting bigger as computing becomes more powerful & affordable as data scientists keep developing more capable algorithms, machine learning will drive greater efficiency in our personal and work lives.
